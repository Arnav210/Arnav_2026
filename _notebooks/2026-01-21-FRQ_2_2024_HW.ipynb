    "## Areas of Struggle\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a couple of areas of struggle, though fairly small and simple to fix. The first is that I get sort of confused on when a class should be private, public, or neither, and that was causing errors for a while when I was trying to run my code becuase there were multiple publics or a class was incorrectly private, etc. The second thing that I struggle with is syntax, as I am not used to coding in java too much and so I don't do proper syntax on occasion. The last thing that I struggle with is variable typing, where I sometimes forget to give variables a type and that causes errors as you can imagine."
