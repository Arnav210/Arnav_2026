    "> Our generic objective was to add to and maintain our teacher's website which is used throughout courses by many students. Our group's specific task was to design and create a **preferences and accessibility system** into the website with the goal of improving user experience and appeal due to everyone's unique preferences.\n",

    "For this sprint, and for the first time, I was actually the **scrum master**. It is a role I've been wanting for a while now, so I was extremely happy that I was able to test my skill in managing a team. This definitely was a new experience, and it also came with new challenges. At first, I was slightly bad at taking charge and leading my team on what we should be doing, but I think that I improved on that skill throughout the trimester, especially with the scrum-oriented reviews where I needed to deeply understand what my entire team was doing. Overall, being a scrum master significantly improved my leadership skills, communication skills, and time management skills.\n",

    "I think, with all honesty, that this sprint has been a fun one. The immense creative freedom as well as the new experience of being a scrum master really allowed me to grow as a student/learner as well as a leader and communicator. There are still some things that I would change, though. For example, I still think that I could've communicated to my team better and also communicated with my teacher more on what I was working on so I could make sure to stay on track.\n",
