    "For our project, there are two major steps that I want to take. Firstly, I want to make checkpoints more accurate and engaging for the user by making the validation use AI to help grade rather than just checking for specific keywords, since I think that could really help users with learning the concepts. Secondly, I want to integrate some backend into the checkpoints so that the responses and validation cna be sent to perhaps the admins for more interaction with a teacher so that they can see the progress each student is making easier.\n",

While there were a few improvements I could see, it blew me away. \n",
