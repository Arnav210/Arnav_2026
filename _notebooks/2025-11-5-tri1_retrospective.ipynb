    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, there are two major steps that I want to take. Firstly, I want to make checkpoints more accurate and engaging for the user by making the validation use AI to help grade rather than just checking for specific keywords, since I think that could really help users with learning the concepts. Secondly, I want to integrate some backend into the checkpoints so that the responses and validation can be sent to perhaps the admins for more interaction with a teacher so that they can see the progress each student is making easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "That ties into the thing I want to learn next well. I didn't get much experience with both AI and Backend throughout this tri, and both are things that I percieve to be extremely useful and want to learn to use and create. "

    "This year's Night at the Museum was genuinely a blast. I arrived in time to see the projects from CSSE and CSP along with presenting my own work, and I was really amazed with the projects that the CSSE and CSP kids were able to make, especially CSSE's game. While there were a few improvements I could see, it blew me away. \n",

However, that didn't really happen during our shift, which was nice.\n",
    "\n",

    "*Purpose* - People usually think that the project is 'very cool' yet are still somewhat confused about what it can be used for and who would use it. To clear this confusion, our presentations should more clearly state the purpose and describe things such as use cases and user stories. \n",
    "\n",
    "*User Interaction* - If given the time, allow spectators to interact themselves with the page to allow for more understanding of how it can be used as well as more connection to the actual page.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Styling* - The people we pressented to left us with a sort of common theme. While they enjoyed the vision we had and the functionality of our page, we recieved feedback about the consistency of our submodules (mainly the styling). Because we have a couple of themes going on, it might throw off the overall connection between each submodule."

    "**Teamwork** - For a while in this first trimester, our team's collaboration was quite rocky. However, after some motivation (a .55) we worked out many of our problems and started to plan and delegate tasks properly. While we are in no way perfect, we have definitely improved a lot as a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication** - There were definitely some big issues involving communicating. Me and others were not informing others of what we had gotten done and what we needed to get done, which ended up in a lack of work being split among people and then a lack of work being done. This is still a problem we face today. However, I have taken steps to improve. I try to make thorough issues for planning or task delegation and other things like that and encourage my teammates to update those when they finish their tasks. I also try to make sure that our team is communicating and telling each other what we have to do. \n",
