    "## College Panel Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What inspired your CS major?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many panelists didn't start with computer science as their first choice. Some initially explored other fields like pre-law or corporate careers before discovering their passion for technology. Others found their way through creative interests—building with Legos sparked a love for creating, while photography and filmmaking led to an appreciation for the project-building process. A common thread was finding satisfaction in *making things* and seeing tangible results from their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How did high school prepare you for college?\n",
    "\n",
    "High school classes—especially AP courses—helped develop essential soft skills like **time management**, **communication**, and **planning**. Technical classes like AP CSA provided a foundation, but panelists emphasized that learning to explain complex projects to non-technical audiences was equally valuable. The ability to collaborate and communicate clearly became crucial in college settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking down problems into smaller steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This skill becomes essential in college and professional work. Panelists learned it through experiences like building fullstack applications, where they had to methodically approach each component—framing UI designs, planning APIs before writing code, and tackling one piece at a time. While school teaches this indirectly, real project experience solidifies the habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coming up with project ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "The best project ideas often come from **everyday observations**—noticing problems in daily life and thinking about how technology could solve them. Panelists recommended:\n",
    "- Keeping a running list of ideas as they come up\n",
    "- Conducting user research and customer interviews\n",
    "- Testing wireframes with real users to discover unexpected use cases\n",
    "- Taking classes focused on ideation and human-centered design\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlighting CS in college essays\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing solely on technical skills, successful essays emphasized:\n",
    "- **Personal fit** and unique experiences over career aspirations\n",
    "- **Impact and community involvement**, like starting nonprofits\n",
    "- **Collaboration** and how working with others shaped their growth\n",
    "- **Curiosity** as a driving force in their CS journey\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most valuable skills from STEM classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond technical knowledge, panelists highlighted:\n",
    "- **Critical thinking** and deep problem-solving\n",
    "- **Grit and resilience**—the rigor of challenging courses prepared them for college stress\n",
    "- **Public speaking** and presenting technical work\n",
    "- **Taking initiative** and working with freedom on self-directed projects\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The importance of communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication is *essential* in CS. No one else will share your exact vision, so you need to articulate your ideas clearly. Panelists noted that without communication, your contributions go unnoticed. Practical approaches include writing documentation so knowledge persists, and talking directly with users to understand how they'll actually interact with your product.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experience with Agile/Scrum\n",
    "\n",
    "Exposure to Agile methodologies varied. Some hadn't encountered formal Agile until college or internships due to how classes are structured, while others used it in project-based courses taught by industry professionals. All agreed that understanding Agile becomes important for large-scale collaborative projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final advice\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Stay current** — Research opportunities, look for internships, and stay engaged with the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Have fun** — Don't forget to enjoy the process; it's okay to relax sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Be intentional** — Look at whether courses are lecture-based or project-based, and actively seek out opportunities that match your learning style."
